                <p class="text">Hellooo, Dwi Mulyani Indrawati!
                    The most hard-working but humble person ive ever met in my life. I thank Allah many times for making us meet in 2010 and letting this friendship embrace us for almost more than 14 years through ups and downs. During those 14 years, im so sorry if there were moments when i didnt show up for you, or you felt like i wasnt there. I’m truly sorry, but you know deep down i always love you and care for you. The yeni i know now is still the same as the yeni i knew when we were in junior high school—always nice, always patient, always seeing things positively, never complaining, and always making her mom proud. And im proud too, looking at what youve reached so far.
                    
                    Yen, im not a good friend, but being your friend taught me how to be one. Im so grateful i have you in my life. I may have said that above but i could say it a thousand times, im really happy that Allah put you in my life. Ive learned a lot of things from you, how you always put a smile on your face despite how hard life crashes into you with bad things, how you always manage to give love to others when you also need it the most, how you dont complain a lot when things suck, you just smile. And since 2010, youve always been there for me too. So this year, with all those tears, those struggles youve been through, i hope your 26th brings lots of happiness, and i hope all of those prayers, wishes, and the things youve always imagined will come true. Maybe not all at once, but one by one, they wil happen. What matters is that theyre becoming your reality, just like youve always dreamed. Actually, not just for your 26th but for all the years ahead, my prayers are always the same.
                    
                    So, happiest birthday, yen. Above all those wishes, i really want you to always be healthy and happy, okay? im glad i can still be one of your good friends from 2010 to congratulate you on your birthday. I hope i will always be, until we are old. Once again, happy birthday, eni. Life might be hard sometimes but you will always have me whenever youre feeling low. Im just one call away. Stop keeping things to yourself, okay? Remember, we dont just share happiness together, but also sadness, struggles, and everything else. 
                    
                    I love you!.
